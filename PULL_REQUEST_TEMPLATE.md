- [ ] Did you serve the site at `./docs` and assert that any changes don't break exist functionality? Your locally served site should match the documentation located at https://davidjvitale.com/tech/jekyll-leaflet/.
- [ ] If implementing a new feature, did you add a new section in the `./docs/` site?
